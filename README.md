# MovieFinder

Context
- You’ll be building a small app to demonstrate some basic coding skills in Swift and the iOS SDK. This app is meant to represent some common challenges you will encounter in normal day-to-day development work.

Ground Rules

There are some basic ground rules to follow as you build out the app:
- Please use Swift as your core coding language
- The app should compile without any errors or warnings
- You should not have any autolayout warnings
- Please use UIKit as your base language. SwiftUI is not recommended.
- Please do not use any 3rd party libraries. The example requirements have been built in a way that should not require any additional libraries outside of the iOS SDK and Xcode.
- Please use the latest version of Xcode and iOS tooling.


Requirements
- You will be building an app based on the MovieDB API. This app will allow you to search for
movies, list them, and browse to a detail view for each movie.

Details
- The API key is embedded in the project. You shouldn’t need to set up a new API key or account to finish the project.
- The user should be able to search for a movie, scroll a list of results, and tap on any result to view movie details.
- Perform any transformations on the API data as necessary to accomplish the UI presented here.
- You will need 2 API requests to complete the project: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies, https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/images
- The Search screen should contain the search UI and load search results in place underneath
- A placeholder image (included in the project) should load on the detail screen until the poster image for the screen is downloaded.
- Please use storyboard to create your initial UI and lay out the screen. Add code as needed for
functionality.
